            <aside>
                <p><span class="drop-cap">*</span>When I began writing books, then publishing those books on my own, I started wondering if I was capable of creating my own book covers. I loved the painted book covers, and I started watching YouTube tutorials of artists I admired. They painted beautiful images and made it look incredibly easy.</p> 
                <p><br /><br />Well, I learned the hard way that it's not. My first attempts at painting something were laughable. Blobby people with misshapen faces and anatomy that doesn't exist in the real world. But after a lot of time and a lot of practice both on my own and in classroom settings, I eventually found myself creating works of art I was actually proud of. These are a few of those pieces.</p> 
                <p><br /><br />I created most of these pieces in Adobe Photoshop and Procreate for iPad, and one piece was created in the 3D program Maya.</p>
